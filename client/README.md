The frontend uses a React + Vite template.

# Creating the template
To create the template, I did the following:
    - Made sure I was under the `/client` directory.
    - In the command prompt, I typed `npm create vite@latest .`, to create the Vite project under this directory.
    - For the framework, I selected React. For the variant, I selected JavaScript.
    - I chose not to use rolldown-vite, and installed with npm.
    - The frontend is now accessible at `localhost:5173`.

# Accessing the frontend
In order to access the frontend, you must:
    1. Make sure you are in the `client` directory.
    2. Run `npm run dev` in the command line. Note that running this command is separate from starting the backend.
    3. The frontend is now accessible at `localhost:5173`.
